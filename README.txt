Multi-Container Code Deployment System README
Overview
This README provides an overview of the multi-container code deployment system utilizing Docker, Travis CI, and AWS for automatic testing and deployment.

Components:
Docker: Docker is used for containerization, providing isolation and consistency across development, testing, and deployment environments.
Travis CI: Travis CI is utilized for continuous integration, automating the testing process whenever code changes are pushed to the master branch.

AWS: AWS is used for deployment, providing scalable infrastructure to host multi-container applications.
Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up the multi-container code deployment system:

1. Docker Setup:
Ensure Docker is installed on your development machine.
Dockerize your application by creating Dockerfiles for each service in the project.
Utilize Docker Compose to define and manage multi-container applications.
Build Docker images for your services using docker-compose build.

2. Travis CI Setup:
Sign in to Travis CI with your GitHub account.
Enable the repository where your code is hosted.
Create a .travis.yml file in the project root directory to configure the CI process.
Configure Travis CI to build Docker images and run tests on every push to the master branch.

3. AWS Deployment Setup:
Set up an AWS account if you haven't already.
Use AWS services like ECS (Elastic Container Service) or EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) to deploy your multi-container application.
Configure Travis CI to automatically deploy the application to AWS after successful testing.
Usage
Once the setup is complete, the multi-container code deployment system will automatically trigger the following workflow:

Push Code Changes: Push code changes to the master branch.
Travis CI Testing: Travis CI will detect the changes, pull the code, build Docker images, and run tests.
Automatic Deployment: Upon successful testing, Travis CI will automatically deploy the multi-container application to AWS.
Additional Notes
Ensure proper security measures are in place for AWS deployment, including IAM roles, security groups, and network configurations.
Monitor Travis CI builds and AWS deployments for any errors or issues.
Regularly update dependencies and configurations to maintain system stability and security.
